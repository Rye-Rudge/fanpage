            <p>Winter is the best season ever and heres why. Winter is the season of Christmas, the best dtime of the year! Its aslo the time of Jesus birthday, new years, even more birhtdays, and more! Its the one time of the year its actually cold out, and if you wanna drink hot coco its actually the right weather to drink it. I love waking up on Christmas morning being freezing cold, its just the best feeling! During winter you can do so much, you can go skiing, icesaking, you can go to the park and look at Christmas lights, you can make your chirstmas list while drinking hot coco, you can sleep and be cold, you can watch Christmas movies, and so much more. Like you cant ever say "im board" during winter. I think winter is the best and if its not your favorite season thats ok but personly I love winter.</p>
